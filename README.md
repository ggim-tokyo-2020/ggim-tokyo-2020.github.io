## Information about the novel Corona virus situation
The local Host would like to inform the novel Corona virus situation in Japan, as of 19 February. According to the official information from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, the total number of patients in Japan is 59 including 1 death. Among them 10 patients was found from residents of Tokyo metropolis. The other mass media tells the number of patients over 600 in Japan, but most of them were found in a cruise ferry and they are isolated.

During the conference, we will prepare anti-virus hand wash and also provide sanitary masks at the venue. 

We hope this information will help you. We will also let you know any updates as soon as possible if we have any change on the conference.
